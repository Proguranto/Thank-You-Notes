# Thank-You-Notes
Short Thank You Notes for the CSE143X TA's, to express our thanks for their hard work.
Please install all the files from the repository and run it in your command prompt/IDE.
I am still a beginner so this is still a novice program, but I hope you still enjoy it!
Lastly, I wrote this program for fun and reached out to as many students as I knew that took CSE 143X to write out
their Thank You Notes and collected them to build a short, fun interactive java program.
